# magic-square-detector

A magic square is a square matrix of numbers (usually positive integers) whose row, column, and diagonal sums all equal the same number.<br />
For example:<br />
2 7 6<br />
9 5 1<br />
4 3 8

All 3 rows, columns, and both diagonals equal 15, therefore making this square matrix a magic square.

This program checks these qualifications to determine if a given 3x3 matrix is a magic square.<br />
To check if a 3x3 matrix is a magic square, change "file.txt" so that each row of the matrix is separated by a new line, and each column by a single space.<br />
In other words, "file.txt" should look like the example above.

There are 8 total magic squares that can be made from a 3x3 matrix. See if you can find them all!

This project originally began as a lab assignment for a class.

# Example
2 7 6<br />
9 5 1<br />
4 3 8

Rows:<br />
2 + 7 + 6 = 15<br />
9 + 5 + 1 = 15<br />
4 + 3 + 8 = 15

Columns:<br />
2 + 9 + 4 = 15<br />
7 + 5 + 3 = 15<br />
6 + 1 + 8 = 15

Diagonals: <br />
2 + 5 + 8 = 15<br />
6 + 5 + 4 = 15
