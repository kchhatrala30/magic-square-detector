A magic square is a square matrix of numbers (usually positive integers) whose row, column, and diagonal sums all equal the same number.
For example:
2 7 6
9 5 1
4 3 8

All 3 rows, columns, and both diagonals equal 15, therefore making this square matrix a magic square.

This program checks these qualifications to determine if a given 3x3 matrix is a magic square.
To check if a 3x3 matrix is a magic square, change "file.txt" so that each row of the matrix is separated by a new line, and each column by a single space.
In other words, file.txt should look like the example above.

There are 8 total magic squares that can be made from a 3x3 matrix. See if you can find them all!
